                  <p class="paragraph">
                    I'm a PHP junior backend developer who loves working with
                    Laravel to build powerful APIs. Most of my experience
                    revolves around creating the "engine" that drives web
                    applications - the part users don't see and appreciate but
                    definitely feel when it works smoothly.

                  My main focus is developing robust APIs that connect systems
                  and make applications work seamlessly. I've worked on projects
                  involving RESTful APIs and have experience with single-page
                  applications. While I primarily identify as a back/end
                  developer, I sometimes venture into fullstack territory. I'll
                  be honest - UI design isn't my strongest suit (I usually reach
                  for frontend libraries to help me out), but that just means I
                  really appreciate good frontend developers!

                    I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that makes
                    life easier for everyone involved. Documentation matters to
                    me, and I'm always looking to improve my skills and learn
                    new technologies.

                  <p class="paragraph">
                    Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in vanilla PHP, HTML,
                    CSS, and JavaScript because I feel there's too much "magic"
                    in the tools I'm currently using, and it feels like I've
                    skipped over important abstractions and overall
                    fundamentals. Additionally, I'm learning game development as
                    a hobby so that I won't get burned out with coding, which
                    I'm pretty excited about.
